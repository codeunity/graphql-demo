# GraphQL with Subscriptions over Websockets Demo

This repository is a minimal example for a GraphQL Subscription over Websockets with a C# dotnet 6 backend.

The backend provides a single subscription that represents the current date time and updates every second.

It is used as an example in our blog. See <a href="https://www.codeunity.de/blog/live-datenaktualisierung-mit-graphql-und-websockets" target="_blank">codeunity Blog</a>.
